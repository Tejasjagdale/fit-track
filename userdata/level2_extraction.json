The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands and elbows are placed closer together, which places more of an emphasis on the triceps. The close-grip bench press is often used as an accessory movement for the traditional bench press, or as a triceps builder for arm training. Similar to the bench press, it can be trained in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle or strength endurance.",

            "short_desc": "The biceps curl to shoulder press is a dumbbell complex that combines two exercises that build and strengthen the biceps and shoulders or deltoids. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you structure the sets and reps, it is a time-efficient way to hit two crucial upper-body muscles in any workout.",
